profiling with gprof:
1- compile with -pg flag:
  g++ -pg main.cpp -o mainp
2- run (this will generate gmont.out):
  ./mainp
3- profile
  gprof mainp > out

-========================
Do not use any optimization with profiling, it messes up with everything. 
Run wiht -O0. However, if you use -O2, that is making more sense. Because you eventually want to use the optimized version of the code. So it makes sense to profile the optimized version of the code.

-========================
use ddt


=========================
time ./main  (to time the executable)
