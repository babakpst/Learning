OOP desing methods:
- creational: Object instantiation - hides the mechanisms from the rest of the program
- structral: class relationships and hierarchies
- behaivoral: object intercommunication


Creational pattern:
- factory method (most common)
- abstract factory
- builder: separates the construction of complex objects.
- prototype
- singleton


-- singleton: used when we want to have a globally accessed var with only one instance of it. This is superior than the static, in the sense that it does not allow multiple instantiation of the class. 
   globally accessible
   must be only one instance of the class
