@brief Illustrates doxygen-style comments for documenting a C++
program file and the functions in that file.
@details If you want to add any further detailed description of
what is in the file, then place it here (after the first statement)
and it will appear in the detailed description section of the HTML
output description for the file.

/**
@mainpage
This short program contains some sample code illustrating 
how the doxygen comments must appear
- for documenting a file, and in particular
- for documenting functions
.
when we intend to use the doxygen tool for preparing HTML
documentation of our code. Note that this file is intended
<em>only</em> to illustrate a particular set of <b>commenting
conventions</b> and how they show up when implemented with
doxygen. Your actual requirements may not be the same as
shown here. Im particular you may need less (or more) than
is shown here.

Pay careful attention, in the source code,\n to the distinction
between the special doxygen comments,<br>which produce output
here, and regular C++ comments which are ignored by doxygen,
and look at the source code to see how line breaks in this
paragraph are produced.
