1.      Install Doxygen and Graphviz. In my case, I only had to install Graphviz (and I am using linux fedora)

sudo yum install graphviz

2.      Go to the folder where your source files are located.

3.      doxygen -g

This will generate a configuration file, named ‘Doxyfile’.

4.      Modify Doxyfile if necessary. To generate a callgraph, you need to set up appropriately. I changed the following properties. 

HAVE_DOT               = YES

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

CALL_GRAPH             = YES

5.      Then you run doxygen:

doxygen Doxyfile

6.      New folder ‘html’ and ‘latex’ will be generated, and you can find all the documentations in the folders.

 

to include subdirectories:  RECURSIVE =YES


==================
important remark
The Doxyfile should be in the folder that main.cpp is.
