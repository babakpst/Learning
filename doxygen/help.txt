1. Install Doxygen and Graphviz. In my case, I only had to install Graphviz (and I am using linux fedora)

sudo yum install graphviz

2. Go to the folder where your source files are located.

3. $ doxygen -g

This will generate a configuration file, named ‘Doxyfile’. You only need to do it once.

4. Modify Doxyfile if necessary. To generate a callgraph, you need to set up appropriately. I changed the following properties. 

HAVE_DOT               = YES

EXTRACT_ALL            = YES

EXTRACT_PRIVATE        = YES

EXTRACT_STATIC         = YES

CALL_GRAPH             = YES

RECURSIVE              = YES //to include subdirectories:

5. Then you run doxygen:

doxygen Doxyfile

6. New folder ‘html’ and ‘latex’ will be generated, and you can find all the documentations in these folders.
In the html folder there is index.html, which contains the graphical view of the code. Open it in a browser. 
In the latex folder, there is refman.tex, process it in latex and get the pdf documentation.

 




==================
important remark
The Doxyfile should be in the folder that main.cpp is.
