Dynamic library:

- also called shared library
- linked at run time
- every program can access this library at the run time and can avoid creation of multiple copies for every program.


To create the library:
- write the library function, similar to an ordinary c++ file.
- create the object files from the functions: g++ -c lib_*.cpp -fpic
- create a single dynamic library: g++ *.o -shared -o lib_calc.so
- put all the library function declarations in a .h file and include that in the main.
- compile the code to create the object files, including the main: g++ -c *.cpp
- create the executable by linking: g++ -o main main.o -L. lib_name.a

- to check/list the dynamic dependency of the main: ldd main 
- if library not found copy the library in the root dir (usr/lib), or use the complete dir.
- Indicate the path to the library: export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=:/home/babak/Codes/Learning/C++/00_general/58_library/dynamic
